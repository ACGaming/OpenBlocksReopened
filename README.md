# OPENBLOCKS REOPENED

### OpenBlocks Reopened is a fork of [OpenBlocks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/openblocks) by the [OpenMods](https://www.curseforge.com/members/openmods) team, patching long-lasting bugs, adding QoL changes along with additional features.

As of v1.8.3, **OpenModsLib** is no longer required!

**Changes so far:**

* Player XP gets stored inside graves (courtesy of [Pocketkid2](https://github.com/Pocketkid2))
* Improved hang glider deployment and outdoor checks, only decreasing height when exposed to rain
* Config setting for ignoring elevator colors for more variation
* Fixed damage calculations of the Last Stand enchantment
* Sneaking on XP drains increases draining speed of player XP
* Sprinklers have sounds and moisturize farmland
* Enhanced tile entity checks for the magnet and golden egg

# OPENBLOCKS

**OpenBlocks** is a compilation of blocks and items that greatly enhance some lacking aspects of both vanilla and modded
Minecraft. There's not a specific theme to this mod, it is more of a collection of random useful tools for a player to
work with in the game.

* **Village highlighter** -- shows the village borders and where their golem guardians spawn
* The **Slimalizer**, which detects slime chunks
* **Paths**, an alternative to gravel roads

* The **Rope Ladder** -- a magic ladder that doesn’t need support to hold itself up and adjusts its own size to match
  the ground. Single use.
* The **Donation Station** -- tells you which mod a block or item comes from, and lets you support the modder that
  created it
* A painting/staining system for blocks, including:
    * A **Paint Mixer** -- makes paint using dyes and milk. Millions of colors possible.
    * A paint **brush** to paint white **canvases** and other blocks.
